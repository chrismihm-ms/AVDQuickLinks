Below is a collection of links to help distinguish between Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365 and best use cases where to use them.  

**Potential use cases**
<p>The greatest demand for enterprise virtual desktop solutions comes from:</p>

- Security and regulation applications, such as financial services, healthcare, and government.
- Elastic workforce needs, such as remote work, mergers and acquisitions, short-term employees, contractors, and partner access.
- Specific employees, such as bring your own device (BYOD) and mobile users, call centers, and branch workers.
- Specialized workloads, such as design and engineering, legacy apps, and software development testing.

**Types of Microsoft Azure Based VDI deployments:**
- Multi-Session AVD ($$) - Most common type of VDI where users get a pooled desktop
- Single Session AVD ($$$) - Typically for power users, developers, VIPs where users get personal desktop that can auto-scale
- Remote Apps ($) - If you want to deliver an app by publishing it for the user and not give someone full desktop
- Windows 365($$$$) - Easy deployment, fixed cost, personal desktop for users
