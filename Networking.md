# Azure Virtual Desktop Networking
Below is a collection of Azure Virtual Desktop links to help with understanding AVD Networking concepts and guidelines.

 

Traffic flow for Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD).

#### Feed Discovery:
Client ↔ Firewall/Router ↔ Internet ↔ Web Service
 
#### RDP Connection (Reverse Connect Transport):
##### Outbound Traffic:
Client → Firewall/Router → Internet → RD Gateway
Host → Firewall → (possibly a NAT Gateway, which is recommended) → RD Gateway
##### Inbound Traffic:
RD Gateway → Internet → Firewall/Router → Client
RD Gateway → NAT Gateway → Firewall → Host
 
The above assumes that the default route is configured to point to a firewall. Technically, the inbound traffic will be routed along the same path as the outbound traffic. However, the key consideration here is that since we are using **Reverse Connect**, the traffic is always initiated from both the client and the host. This means that it will be trusted by any **stateful firewall** (such as Azure Firewall), so inbound rules won't apply in this case.
 
For **RDP Shortpath** over public networks, the traffic (using ICE/STUN or TURN) will also be initiated from both the client and the host. As such, the same concept of **trusted traffic** applies here as well.

- [Configure RDP Shortpath for Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/configure-rdp-shortpath?tabs=managed-networks) to establish direct connectivity between the remote desktop client and the session host. This provides a number of benefits including:
    - reduces dependency on the Azure Virtual Desktop gateways reducing RTT improving latency-sensitive applications resulting in an improved user experience
    - Increases the bandwidth available for each user session
    - Improves the reliability of each user session
