# Azure Virtual Desktop Proof of Concept
Below is a basic outlinde of setting up an initial AVD Proof of Concept.

***Prereqs***
- Azure Active Directory tenant
- Azure Subscription
- Available Quota in subscription for desired VM instance
- Register Resource Provider - Make sure to register the *Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization* resource provider for your subscription
- Permissions/RBAC - For purposes of PoC, the admin account should have Contributor and User access administrator role scoped to subscription. 
- Internet access from the VM that gets deployed. For more information, see [Required FQDNs and endpoints for Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/required-fqdn-endpoint)

***Overview***
- Create a host pool.
- Create a workspace.
- Create an application group.
- Create session host virtual machines.
- Assign users or groups to the application group for users to get access to desktops and applications.

### Create an initial host pool
Login to Azure portal and in the search filed at the top of the portal, search for "Azure Virtual Desktop" and click that to lauch the AVD blade.

In Create a host pool Basics tab, use the dropdown and *select the subscripion* you're looking to deploy AVD resources to. Either *select or "Create new"* a resourcs Group. Enter in a *Host Pool name* and *select the region* where the Azure Virtual Desktop object will be created. The metadata for the object will be stored in the geography associated with the region. For Preferred app group type, *Select between "Desktop" or "RemoteApp"*. For Host pool type, *Select between "Pooled" or "Personal"*. For Create Session Host Configuration, *Select No or Yes*. At the bottom click on the *Next:Session hosts"* button to move to the next configuration section.

In the Create a host pool Session hosts tab, for Add virtual machines, Select *"Yes"*. Fields will open up for configuring the session hosts. In the Resource Group section, *select the resrouce group* that you would like the session hosts to be deployed to. Enter in a *Name Prefix* for you session hosts.Virtual machine type is defaulted to *Azur Virtual machine*. Leave it on that. Select *Virtual machine location*. For Availability options, select you desired availability option. For POC, we typically set this to *"No infrastrcuture redundancy required"*. Select the *Security type* you want to use. For POC we typically leave the default of *"Trusted launch virtual machines"*. For Image, select one of the market place images you would like to use. For POC, We typically use the *"Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session, Version 24H2 + Microsoft 365 Apps"*. Select the *"Virtual machine size"* that you would like to use. Enter in the *"number of VMs"* (session hosts) you would like to deploy. For OS disk type, Select *"Standard SSD"* and for OS disk size leave the *"Default size (128GiB)"*.

Select the *"Virtual network"* and *"Subnet"* that you would like the session hosts to use. Select *"Network security group type"*. For POC, we typically set this to *"None"*. In the Domain to join section, Select which directory you would like the session hosts to join. For POC, we typically set this to *"Microsoft Entra ID"*.Enter in a Virtual machine administrator account *"Username"* and *"Password"*. At the bottom click on the *Next:Workspace"* button to move to the next configuration section.
